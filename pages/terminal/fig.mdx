# Fig

[Fig](https://fig.io) is _The next-generation command line._

It makes me super fast when navigating directories or doing basically anything in the terminal.

## Install

```bash copy
brew install fig
```

## How I use Fig?

The main feature of Fig I use constantly is **Autocomplete**. As you write, Fig will display suggestions relevant to your command.

The second reason I use Fig is because how easy it is to install **terminal plugins** with it.

- [`spaceship-prompt`](https://spaceship-prompt.sh) - more useful prompt
- `zsh-syntax-highlighing` - helps spot mistakes
- `you-should-use` - reminder that _you should use..._
- [`wd`](/terminal/wd) - waypoints for your directories
