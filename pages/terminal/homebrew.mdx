# Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is _The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)_

If I can install something with Homebrew, I probably will.

## Install

```bash copy
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Updating

Updating apps installed with Homebrew is as easy as running these two commands:

```bash
brew update
# and then ...
brew upgrade
```
