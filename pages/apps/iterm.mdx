# iTerm

I like things **clean** and **simple**. I have nothing against the default MacOS Terminal, but I was missing features like tabs or panel splitting, so I switched to iTerm.

## Install

You can download iTerm from [here](https://iterm2.com/index.html) and install it directly.

Or you can do it the **better way** and use [Homebrew](/terminal/homebrew).

```bash copy
brew install --cask iterm2
```

## Make it look good

The default look of iTerm is fine, but we can do better.

<Steps>

### Theme

I like to use the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/iterm). To install it, follow the instructions on the page.

After setting up the theme, I like to dial down the purple background. Under _Settings → Profiles → Colors_ set the background color to `#16161a`.

### Prompt

Using [Fig](/terminal/fig) install _spaceship-prompt_ and _zsh-syntax-highlighing_. These two plugins not only look nice, they are also very **useful**.

### Final change

Under _Settings → Appearance_ change the theme to **Minimal**.

</Steps>

## Shortcuts

As mentioned above, I like to split my terminal into multiple panels.

- split your terminal horizontally, press `⌘ D`
- split your terminal vertically, press `⇧ ⌘ D`
- close current panel with `⌘ W`
